# Frequently Asked Questions

## What do you do in RCOS?

In a semester of RCOS, you work with a team (or solo) on an open-source project. You can either start your own project and manage a team of students or join an existing project and work under a project lead.

## What kind of course credit can you receive?

You can register for RCOS for any amount of free elective credits. You can also take RCOS for 0 credits - for experience only - without obligation for attendance, contributions, and final presentations.

## How often does RCOS meet?

RCOS meets twice weekly for two hours on Tuesdays and Fridays, typically from 4 pm to 6 pm, where attendance is required. Other one-off workshops and events are held throughout the semester, where attendance is optional.

## How much time is expected per week?

You are expected to work on your RCOS project for, at minimum, the 4-hours a week that the course meets. If you take RCOS for credit, you are expected to work a few more hours each week based on your credit count. If you take RCOS for no credit, you are encouraged to work consistently weekly. Still, you are under no obligation to do so.

## What kind of projects can I work on?

The only requirement for an RCOS project is that it be open source. While we mostly have software projects, hardware projects are welcome and encouraged. Projects range from full-stack web apps, native applications, mobile applications, video games, programming languages, and more. Check out [new.rcos.io/projects](https://new.rcos.io/projects/) for the complete list of projects!

## Do I have to finish my project?

No! RCOS looks for consistent work, not a fully-fledged, completed project at the end of the semester. You are graded by how consistently you worked with your team towards the milestones you set at the start of the semester. We recognize plans change and sometimes fail! As a result, you can work on the same project multiple semesters, and we encourage project leads to do so.

## Do I need Computer Science experience to join?

You do not need prior programming/hardware/CS experience to join RCOS; all majors are welcome. However, different projects will require different levels of experience from their members. Often, many projects each semester welcome beginners and are willing to teach members how to get started and contribute. There are also workshops held by members throughout each semester on different technologies, frameworks, languages, etc., to learn from. We strongly encourage at least CS1 experience for those getting started with RCOS.

## What are some successful RCOS projects?

[YACS](https://yacs.cs.rpi.edu/), in development since 2010, lets students create course schedules. Another well-known course scheduler is [Quacs](https://quacs.org/). [LEGUP](https://github.com/Bram-Hub/LEGUP) is a better way to learn formal logic. [Shuttle Tracker](https://web.shuttletracker.app/) is RPI's primary source for shuttle locations.

## Why is RCOS a unique RPI organization?

RCOS is a student-run organization that allows students to work on what interests them and receive course credit for it.
