# Mentors

Mentors are the life blood of RCOS, a mentor can help you with technical problems, show you where/how to find help for your project, and help you find a new project etc.

### Mentor Responsibilities

- Review project proposals at the start of the semester.
- Look after a small group of projects and their members as your mentees (usually ~2 mentors per small group).
  - Grade Status Updates for their mentees
  - Grade Mid-Year Reviews for their mentees
- Host at least one [workshop session](/events/hosting) for the RCOS community
- Help point students to what they need to do/where they need to go within RCOS.
- Ensure your mentees are on their schedule OR have documented reasons to be off their schedule.
- Set up whatever organization/goal structure you feel is best for helping students be successful with their open source contributions; this is what gives a small group personality.
- In general, help maintain the freedom and culture of RCOS and encourage open source contribution.

### To be a good mentor...

- Help mentees to reach their own goals.
- Talk directly to projects and mentees, understand what their project is and where you can help.
- Share ideas and contribute to development of RCOS as a whole - as long as you're monitoring the #mentors Discord channel you should have opportunities to contribute.

### Mentors should know...

- The grading rubric for Status Updates.
- Names and channels for referring mentees to Coordinators or Faculty Advisor.
- What resources are provided in the Handbook to direct mentees to.

### Becoming a Mentor

At the very start of each semester, a Mentor application form will be published. Mentors are selected before the start of Small Groups and are assigned to projects at that point. Keep an eye out for this call for Mentors each semester!

## External Mentors

External mentors are mentors that help projects remotely. External mentors serve a different role than regular student mentors.

In particular, they get the following exceptions:

- External mentors don't need to attend small and large group meetings
- External mentors don't need to understand the logistics of RCOS (students should ask their student mentors for this)

External mentors have their own sets of requirements, usually they provide a subset of the following responsibilities...

- Get students involved with industry or personal projects outside of RCOS
- Assist students with problems with a technology stack
- Introduce students to new technologies
- Provide advice to students regarding open source technologies
