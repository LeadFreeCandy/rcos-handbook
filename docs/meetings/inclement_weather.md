# Inclement Weather Policy

## Overview

We at RCOS understand that getting to campus during inclement weather may be difficult or unsafe. Below are our policies on canceling or dismissing RCOS meetings due to inclement weather.

## Weekday Meetings and Events

If classes are not in session due to inclement weather, any RCOS events during that day will also be canceled. These events include:

- Large Group Meetings
- Small Group Meetings
- Workshops

Large Groups that are canceled might be rescheduled to another RCOS period to make up.

## Weekend or Holiday Events

If RPI's shuttle service or Safe Ride program is suspended due to inclement weather when classes are not in session, any RCOS events occurring that day will be canceled. This includes:

- Weekend work sessions
- Code Jams
- RCOS Hackathons
- Weekend bonus sessions

If a shuttle service or Safe Ride suspension is announced during an RCOS event, event hosts reserve the right to dismiss the event early so attendees can get home safely.

In the final three weeks of the Fall semester and the first half of the Spring semester, event hosts are encouraged to set aside a "snow date" for any code jams, hackathons, or weekend bonus sessions.
