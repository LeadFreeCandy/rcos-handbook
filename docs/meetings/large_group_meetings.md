# Large Group Meetings

## Overview

Large Group is when the entirety of RCOS gathers for announcements, guest speakers, town hall meetings, or opening/closing ceremonies.

## Time and Frequency

During the first two weeks of the semester, Large Group occurs every Tuesday and Friday to get new community members acquainted with RCOS and to inform existing members on changes in structure and mentorship.

Once all community members are assigned to a Small Group, Large Group will only occur at the end of the Summer. All other Fridays are reserved for Small Group meetings.

Large Group will also occur on the last Friday of the semester for our closing ceremony.

## Announcements

Each Large Group meeting's slides have an announcements section where Coordinators/Faculty Advisors announce important events both in RCOS and externally. RCOS members with interesting announcements about external events or anything else they feel worth sharing with everyone can ask a Coordinator to talk briefly during the Large Group meeting. Don't be hesitant to; we heavily encourage participation! We take note of particularly engaged RCOS members.

## Guest Speakers

RCOS welcomes guest speakers to present their work or research and how it incorporates open-source software. Occasionally, a guest speaker will be given time to present during a Large Group meeting for everyone. These can be anyone from RPI faculty to external companies. These will be announced ahead of time. Guest speaker presentations generally should be at most 40 minutes.

## End of Year Closing Ceremony
