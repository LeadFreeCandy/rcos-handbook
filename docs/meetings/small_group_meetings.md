# Small Group Meetings

!> We are still adapting to the return to restricted in-person courses. This information may change.

## Overview
Small group meetings are where the majority of RCOS project work gets done. Once projects are finalized at the start of the semester, projects are grouped into Small Groups overseen by a Mentor or two and are assigned to a room. During Small Group meetings, you have time to work and discuss with your team, collaborate with other projects, and get help from your Mentors.

## Time and Frequency
Small Group meetings take place during regularly schedule RCOS sections on Tuesdays and Fridays from 4pm to 5:50pm. Attendance is required, with details listed [here](#). Members are expected to work for the majority of the period. Attendance is generally taken after an hour and a half to ensure members are coming and staying.

## Location
Small Groups are assigned to small rooms, typically in Russell Sage Laboratory. Each Small Group (and project) is also given their own Discord voice and text channels on the server which they are encouraged to actively use.

## Standup
Each Small Group meeting should begin with a very brief review of the previous week's work from each project's team members. This ensures Project Leads know how their members are doing, and allows Mentors to proactively provide assistance. It's not meant to show off how much or how little work you were able to complete!

## Open Hacking
The majority of Small Group meeting time should be actual development work on your project. This is when project leads can directly speak with the whole team, delegate tasks, troubleshoot, and manage their project. Mentors can be called in if available to help with technical blockers.
