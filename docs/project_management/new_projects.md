# New Projects

We always welcome new projects! If you want to start a project from scratch, here's how to get your project up and running.

Note that if you are an external organization or external project, these guidelines may vary.

## Forming a Team

You can work by yourself, but managing an open source project by yourself can be very difficult. We highly recommend forming a team if you don't already have one!

#### 1. Project Pitch

You can find team members by word of mouth or by pitching your idea to the RCOS community. Read about Project Pitches [here](project_management/pitch.md).

#### 2. Project Pairing

We have a special team forming process called [Project Pairing](membership/project_pairing), which occurs in the first two weeks of the semester.

## Setup

#### 1. Writing a Proposal

After you form a team, you will have to write a proposal for your project for the current semester. See the [rubric](grading/documentation?id=proposal) for more details on proposals. Make sure it meets the requirements specified, as Mentors/Coordinators will be reviewing these and giving feedback before contributing starts.

#### 2. Project Repository

Create a repository on GitHub (or similar) for your project. Then, create the following:

- README
- LICENSE
- CODE OF CONDUCT _(optional but recommended)_
- CONTRIBUTING _(optional but recommended)_
- Issue/pull request templates _(optional but recommended)_

See our [documentation guide](grading/documentation) for specific guidelines.

<!-- #### 3. Add Your Project to Observatory

Once your repository is setup, create a new project on Observatory. Be sure to link your proposal and repository and make sure all team members join your project (your mentors do not need to join if they are not on the project). -->

#### 3. Discord channel

**You shouldn't have to do anything!** When projects are finalized, we automate the creation of categories for each Small Group which include a voice and text channel for your project. The text channel is only visible to you, your team, and the Coordinators/Faculty Advisors. You are given permission to pin and delete messages in your project's channel. Reach out to a Coordinator if you every have issues with your channel or need help.
