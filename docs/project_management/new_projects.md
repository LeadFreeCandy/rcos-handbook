# New Projects

We always welcome new projects! If you want to start a project from scratch, here's how to get your project up and running.

Note that if you are an external organization or external project, these guidelines may vary.

## Forming a Team

You can work by yourself, but managing an open source project by yourself can be very difficult. We highly recommend forming a team if you don't already have one!

#### 1. How Many People?

If you are starting a brand new project, have little experience with the technologies you are choosing, and/or have little experience with project management, we heavily recommend you **keep your team small** (no more than 6-8 team members). You might think at first that more members means more work gets done, but in reality it means you spend all of your time as a Project Lead teaching and directing your project members! Or, in a worse scenario, you don't have the time and resources to dedicate to everyone and team members fall behind on work and do poorly in RCOS as a result.

- [ ] Determine the maximum number of team members you can handle

#### 2. Pitch Your Idea to RCOS Community

Some Project Leads pitch their project idea via word of mouth and come up with a team that way. That works totally fine! However, if you want to pitch to the general RCOS community for members, you will participate in [Project Pitches](project_management/pitch.md) which take place in the very first few RCOS meetings of the semester. Read more about project pitches at that link.

- [ ] Determine whether to pitch or privately form team
- [ ] Create and submit Project Pitch (if pitching)

#### 3. Project Pairing

If you have pitched your project, you will need to interact with RCOS members who are interested in potentially joining your project! This takes place in an exciting process called [Project Pairing](membership/project_pairing), which occurs immediately after project pitches at the start of the semester. You will represent your project in-person to any interested members, in a sort of speed-dating format. You will get to talk to and pitch your project to many RCOS members to determine if they are interested and a good match for your project. You must give the go-ahead to members who want to join your project, they cannot join just by requesting alone.

- [ ] Attend Project Pairing and represent your project
- [ ] Approve members to join your project

## Setup

#### 1. Writing a Proposal

After you form a team, you will have to write a proposal for your project for the current semester. See the [rubric](grading/documentation?id=proposal) for more details on proposals. Make sure it meets the requirements specified, as Mentors/Coordinators will be reviewing these and giving feedback before contributing starts.

#### 2. Project Repository

Create a repository on GitHub (or similar) for your project. Then, create the following:

- README
- LICENSE
- CODE OF CONDUCT _(optional but recommended)_
- CONTRIBUTING _(optional but recommended)_
- Issue/pull request templates _(optional but recommended)_

See our [documentation guide](grading/documentation) for specific guidelines.

<!-- #### 3. Add Your Project to Observatory

Once your repository is setup, create a new project on Observatory. Be sure to link your proposal and repository and make sure all team members join your project (your mentors do not need to join if they are not on the project). -->

#### 3. Discord channel

**You shouldn't have to do anything!** When projects are finalized, we automate the creation of categories for each Small Group which include a voice and text channel for your project. The text channel is only visible to you, your team, and the Coordinators/Faculty Advisors. You are given permission to pin and delete messages in your project's channel. Reach out to a Coordinator if you every have issues with your channel or need help.
