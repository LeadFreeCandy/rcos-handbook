# Status Update Guidelines

## Overview

**What are Status Updates?**

Status Updates are weekly updates submitted by members detailing what they have done in the past week, what they plan to do next week, and what technical blockers they've encountered. These are intended to keep members on track to completing their goals, and are used by Coordinators and mentors to pinpoint who is falling behind and might need assistance.

**How are Status Updates tracked?**

Currently, a Submitty gradeable is created for a Status Update each week, and members are expected to upload a **text** file in either plaintext, markdown, or similar format. PDFs are also accepted. Word documents are **not allowed** as Submitty cannot display them. Students are automatically enrolled into the RCOS Submitty course at the start of the semester.

**How are Status Updates graded?**

Your Status Updates are factored into your final year grade. See the [Grading Rubric](grading/rubric) for details. Each status update is graded out of 10. The "Plan for this week" and "Plan for next week" sections are both 4 points each and graded on content. The "Blockers" and "Links" section are both 1 point each and graded on completion. You can see the sections and their requirements in more detail below.

?> We drop **2 status updates** each semester, for weeks that you either forget to submit or don't have much to submit.

## Requirements

We ask that each Status Update comprise the following parts. **Each part must be included even if you have nothing to report for that section. Simply state "Nothing to report" or similar.**

### Intro

State your name and project.

### This Week

Summarize what you have contributed in the past week. This includes code, documentation, learning, etc. Remember that someone reading might not be familiar with your project, so give context. If you're unsure how much detail to give, lean on the more detailed side.  We're aiming for thoroughness here! Note that the absolute minimum here for full points is 3 sentences. More sentences may be necessary to fully explain what you did, but fewer than 3 sentences will **not** receive full credit.

### Next Week

Summarize what you plan on doing next week. Our goal here is to have you thinking about what you can do to achieve your goals. Remember that someone reading might not be familiar with your project, so give context. We're aiming for thoroughness here! Note that the absolute minimum here for full points in 3 sentences. More sentences may be necessary to fully explain what you plan to achieve, but fewer than 3 sentence will **not** receive full credit.

### Blockers

List any *technical* blockers you have hit when trying to work on your project. This **does not** include things outside of RCOS that prevented you from getting work done, i.e. "I had a test this week so I couldn't do work".  If you had no blockers for that time period, please write something along the lines of **"No Blockers"** or something similar.

### Links

List direct links to your contributions and any resources you were using for learning. Contributions would be git commits, issues reported or commented on, wiki pages written, etc... they are **not** other people's youtube videos you watched or websites you visited. Mentors need to be able to see proof of your work by following these links. If you had no links for that time week, please write something along the lines of **"No Links"** or something similar.

!> By week 6, we strongly recommend that you start making commits if you haven't already - though it is *not* part of your status update grade, *code is worth 50% of your final grade*.

#### Project Unk

**This Week**<br>This week I investigated the 19 projects in RCOS for the Summer and I settled on the Unk project. I am currently the sole contributor. I wrote the project proposal and set up the github repository. I also opened an issue laying out my plans for next week.

**Next Week**<br>Next week, I plan to create some storyboards describing User/System interactions and begin to create a UI design. I also plan on selecting an open source license for my project and creating a "how to contribute" document. I will also begin surveying my community to put together a potential advisory list.

**Blockers**<br>I have no technical blockers this week.
