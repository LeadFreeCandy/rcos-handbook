# Grading Rubric

Although RCOS is a team sport, grading is done on each individual member.
Make sure you meet the requirements, including the academic integrity policy and the requirements on the project itself such as the README, License and other forms of documentation.

**We have tried to make this rubric broadly applicable to the wide variety of projects we find in RCOS.
Certainly, each category of Open Source Contributions, Status Updates, Presentations, Community Involvement, and Attendance are critical to success in RCOS and often to the Open Source processes as well.
Remember that we can only evaluate your contributions to the extent that you allow us to see what you are doing.
If you have issues with any rubric item, or if you cannot figure out how to make your particular RCOS project openly visible, please talk to a Coordinator or Faculty Advisor so that we can help you be as Open as possible.**

## 50% - Open Source Contributions

RCOS is, at heart, about participation in the Open Source Ecosystem.

| **A** | Makes numerous significant contributions. Student is active on GitHub and Discord and makes excellent use of issue tracking and project management systems. Student communicates failures and development barriers to their team and mentors and documents them for the future, and makes their best effort to overcome challenges. Open contributions are licensed correctly with an OSI approved license, are easy to find and can be easily obtained and used. Gives a Final Status Update that is a concise but complete summary of links to the year's contributions. |

## 25% - Status Updates and Project Documentation

Your community needs to know what you are working on and what you have accomplished, and we need to know that you are engaged throughout the semester.
Keeping us informed with a weekly status update and by keeping your project documentation up to date will help us and will allow us to give you the grade you deserve.

?> View the specific guidelines for Status Updates [here](grading/status_updates) and the specific guidelines for Documentation [here](grading/documentation).

?> Note: Only 2 status updates will be dropped during each semester.

## Citizenship

We want all of you at RCOS to learn in a safe, welcoming, and inclusive environment.
Part of fostering this environment includes practicing good citizenship.
The way you conduct yourself at RCOS may have a long-lasting impact on the community, whether that be positive or negative.

Students who go above and beyond to model and encourage positive behaviors outlined in our community Code of Conduct may receive:

- additional consideration for leadership positions within RCOS (e.g. Mentor, Coordinator)
- recognition from the community as a model citizen

On the other hand, students may be penalized, depending on the severity of the offense, for violating the Code of Conduct.
These penalties are given at Faculty Advisor discretion and may range from a small attendance penalty to an F in the course.
Please review the [Code of Conduct](community/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) as well as our [Bylaws](community/bylaws.md) for more detailed information.

# Grading Rubric for Mentors

Mentors have a unique responsibility within RCOS. As a mentor you are
expected to run a Small Group, be familiar with all the projects in your
group, fill out evaluations, provide guidance and technical support to
projects in your group, and to regularly attend mentor meetings. Additionally, you
are expected to help us plan and execute external events such as code jams,
bonus sessions, and our weekly coding open houses. Because of this added
responsiblity, you are given more leeway on the open source contributions as
well as other rubric items above.

At a minimum a mentor is **required** to host at least one workshop.

## 35% - Open Source Contributions

## 25% - Marking Status Updates

As a mentor you have a respobsibility to the projects under your supervision to mark each student's weekly status updates (and mid/end-of-semester contribution summaries) in a timely and accurate manner.
Each week you and your students will upload status updates to Submitty, and it will be your responsibility to follow the [RCOS Handbook](https://handbook.rcos.io/#/grading/status_updates?id=requirements) and [rubric](https://handbook.rcos.io/#/grading/rubric?id=_50-open-source-contributions) to read through and "mark" your suggested score for each student. **Mentor-submitted marks are subject to secondary screening by coordinators and faculty advisors.**

?> Mentors are expected to communicate early and often with coordinators and faculty advisors in cases where they believe they will be unable to meet their deadline, suspect an academic integrity violation, or have any other hesitation during the marking process.

?> When marking a non-100% score on a status update, mentors should provide a brief explanation (1-3 sentences) explaining why the student did not earn a full score.

## 15% - Presentations

You need to develop the ability to represent yourself, your project and RCOS.
Presentations like the Final Presentation and Mentor Workshop are critical to this learning goal.

**In order to pass the course, a Mentor <ins>MUST</ins> present a [workshop](https://handbook.rcos.io/#/events/workshops) on a topic of their choosing.**

## 10% - Attendance

You cannot learn, participate, or share unless you are here.

As a mentor, you are required to attend every RCOS class. In the case that you cannot make it, you **MUST** let a coordinator know ahead a time (not a few minutes before class!). There are of course exceptions in cases of emergency, but please make your best effort to attend. Mentors who do not attend class will be demoted back to the role of the student with due notice from a coordinator or RCOS faculty member.
